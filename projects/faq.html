        </h2>
        <pre>
    Tubidy indexes videos from user
    generated content. When you
    execute a search, it lists results from 
    the moderated videos which users 
    uploaded.When you want to watch a 
    video, it streams directly from the 
    host site to your phone, through our 
    servers.Our servers do the hard 
    work of transcoding (formatting) the 
    stream on-the-fly to work on your 
    phone and your network.All you 
    need to do is search,watch and enjoy 
    our service.
